**MY OWN SET UP**  

Previously, I was using Windows 10 Professional OS/Operating System;     
when I decided to try...  
- going to Linux Mint web site...and, download for FREE a Linux Mint ISO image  
- inserting a 4.7GB DVD RW disc into the CD drive  
- right click on the ISO file...and, chose burn image to disc  
- selecting the DVD disc to burn the image to  
- rebooted the computer...while pressing down and holding the [ESC] key  
- selected key [F9]...in order to boot from CD drive/Atapi  
- Rebooted, again...;  
- next time, Linux Mint was the OS which booted up/(instead of Windows)

**THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF LINUX OS/OPERATING SYSTEM TO CHOOSE FROM..???**  

Linux Mint OS is just one of many possible Linux OS'es that it's possible to select from;  
I choose this OS, in particular, because I heard it was relatively simple and easy to use,  
especially, for those people who are Windows users.  

The first time I used Linux it was Ubuntu GUI/Graphical User Interface;  
the next time, I used Linux RaspberryPi OS...SBC/Small Board Computer;    
and, another time I tried using Linode Ubuntu CLI/Command Line Interface...    
SSH/Secure Socket Shell-into it through Windows Command Prompt/  
and, also, connecting through Putty/and, Filezilla FTP software.   

But, this time, I had two choices left open to me...  
as I had already finished downloading 2 x Linux OS: 
- Ubuntu LTS/Long Term Support  
- Linux Mint LTS 21.2 "Victoria"   
...I'd already had some previous experience of using Ubuntu GUI before;  
but, nil experience of using Linux Mint; so, as I wanted to try something 'new'...;  
threfore, I decided to load Linux Mint OS, first;  
whereas the use of Ubuntu LTS can wait until, later on.

My own experience so far...is that Linux Mint...works pretty much like using Ubuntu LTS.    
The fact that it's a GUI...also, makes it much easier/and, more instinctive to use    
that having to use a CLI.
