MY OWN SET UP

Previously, I was using Windows 10 Professional OS/Operating System;     
when I decided to try...  
- going to Linux Mint web site...and, download for FREE a Linux Mint ISO image  
- inserting a 4.7GB DVD RW disc into the CD drive  
- right click on the ISO file...and, chose burn image to disc  
- selecting the DVD disc to burn the image to  
- rebooted the computer...while pressing down and holding the [ESC] key  
- selected key [F9]...in order to boot from CD drive/Atapi  
- Rebooted, again...;  
- next time, Linux Mint was the OS which booted up/(instead of Windows)  

THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF LINUX TO CHOOSE FROM..???  

Linux Mint OS is just one of many possible Linux OS'es that it's possible to select from;  
I choose this OS, in particular, because I heard it was relatively simple and easy to use,  
especially, for those people who are Windows users.  

The first time I used Linux it was Ubuntu GUI;  
the next time I used Linux RaspberryPi OS;  
and, another time I tried using Ubuntu CLI.
