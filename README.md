**MY OWN SET UP**  

Previously, I was using Windows 10 Professional OS/Operating System;     
when I decided to try...  
- going to Linux Mint web site...and, download for FREE a Linux Mint ISO image  
- inserting a 4.7GB DVD RW disc into the CD drive  
- right click on the ISO file...and, chose burn image to disc  
- selecting the DVD disc to burn the image to  
- rebooted the computer...while pressing down and holding the [ESC] key  
- selected key [F9]...in order to boot from CD drive/Atapi  
- Rebooted, again...;  
- next time, Linux Mint was the OS which booted up/(instead of Windows)

**THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF LINUX OS/OPERATING SYSTEM TO CHOOSE FROM..???**  

Linux Mint OS is just one of many possible Linux OS'es that it's possible to select from;  
-(in fact, not to confuse things too much; but, there are quite literally 100's of different Linux OS...?!)-;  
I choose this OS, in particular, because I heard it was relatively simple and easy to use,  
especially, for those people who are Windows users.  

Below, is my own history of using Linux...

1> Ubuntu GUI/Graphical User Interface;  
2> Linux RaspberryPi OS...SBC/Small Board Computer;      
3> Linode Ubuntu CLI/Command Line Interface...    
SSH/Secure Socket Shell-into it through Windows Command Prompt/  
and, also, connecting through Putty/and, Filezilla FTP software.   

But, this time, I had two choices left open to me...  
as I had already finished downloading 2 x Linux OS: 
- Ubuntu LTS/Long Term Support  
- Linux Mint LTS 21.2 "Victoria"   
...I'd already had some previous experience of using Ubuntu GUI before;  
but, nil experience of using Linux Mint; so, as I wanted to try something 'new'...;  
threfore, I decided to load Linux Mint OS, first;  
whereas the use of Ubuntu LTS can wait until, later on.

My own experience so far...is that Linux Mint...works pretty much like using Ubuntu LTS.    
The fact that it's a GUI...also, makes it much easier/and, more instinctive to use    
that having to use a CLI.

### Official site

- https://www.linuxmint.com  
- https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php  
- https://www.linuxmint.com/documentation.php

### Initial set up

I found it was very important to access System Settings...  

- choose keyboard 'language': English UK  
- adjust the 'display' to suit you own screen size/eye sight  
- adjust the 'time and date' to suit your own country time zone  
- update the Linux repository with: sudo apt update && apt upgrade -yy  

-----

### Editors

#### Nano

I tried using Nano editor...which I was used to using inside of the Ubuntu Terminal. Yes, everything just like usual.  

#### Xed

- https://github.com/linuxmint/xed - (xed, is a MDI/Multiple Document Interface, or, 'tabbed' text editor...; thus, allowing you to have open multiple different file types, all together at once; you can switch tab order by using simple 'drag and drop'; it also uses 'syntax highlighting' for: CSS/HTML/-etc. All of the normal text editing commands works: [CTRL]+[S] Save/[C] Copy/[X] Cut/[V] Paste/[Z] Undo/[Y] Redo/[N] New tab/[W] close current tab/[Q] Quit editor/-etc.) 

-----

### Programming

- Python3, came automatically right out of the box.

-----

### Terminal

The Terminal application can be accessed in multiple different ways...;  
but, my favourite way to access it is to, simply, press the [Windows picture icon] key;  
and, now, you have two choices...  
- Select the Terminal application icon from the sidebar by clicking on it with your mouse  
- Type into the textbox the word: Terminal...and, then, press [Enter]
- Or, even better: [CTRL]+[SHIFT]+[T]  

-----

### Saving files

If you are just popping into the CD/DVD tray a burned version of Linux OS;  
then, you will still have access to any external drives that are already plugged in;  
this means you can save files very quickly and easily to your chosen external drive/or, mixture of external drives.

-----

### Loading a web page into Firefox web browser

At the terminal just type in...  

> firefox webpageName.html  

...and, then, when you press the [Enter] key...that web page will load up inside of your Firefox web browser ready for viewing.
